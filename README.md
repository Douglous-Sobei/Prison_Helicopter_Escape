# Prison_Helicopter_Escape
> My project was about Prison Breaks and the intention of the project was to learn the following:
- Obtain real data from the internet and prepare it for analysis
- Analyze the data using Python
- Author our first portfolio project in Jupyter Notebook, to share code and communicate results

> Specifically, I answered the following questions:
- In which year did the most helicopter prison break attempts occur?
- In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison breaks occur?
