# Prison_Helicopter_Escape
> My project was about Prison Breaks and the intention of the project was to learn the following:
- Obtain real data from the internet and prepare it for analysis
- Analyze the data using Python
- Author our first portfolio project in Jupyter Notebook, to share code and communicate results

> Specifically, I answered the following questions:
- In which year did the most helicopter prison break attempts occur?
- In which countries do the most attempted helicopter prison breaks occur?

> in my efforts of getting data, got the data from the [List of helicopter prison escapes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes) Wikipedia article.

> finally, in answering my questions, I got the following:
- Most helicopter prison break attempts occurred in 1986, 2001, 2007 and 2009, with a total of three attempts each.
- The country with the most helicopter prison escape attempts was France
